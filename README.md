# ðŸ’± nbpTracker

**nbpTracker** is a .NET 8 Web API application that periodically fetches currency exchange rates from the National Bank of Poland (NBP) â€” specifically from Table B â€” and stores them in a SQLite database. It exposes RESTful endpoints for retrieving the stored rates, which can be consumed by a separate frontend application (React).
